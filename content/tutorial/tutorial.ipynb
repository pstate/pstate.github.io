    "An effective way to start creating your own models with pState (or statecharts in general), a good rule of thumb is to follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Start with some list of events that are possible in your model.\n",
    "2. List all the possible states in your model. Group them if necessary (using what we've shown in this tutorial)\n",
    "3. Decide on the transitions.\n",

    "Some things to take note of:\n",
    "* When deciding on your states, sometimes what you may want is a variable to represent a state or  even multiple states. For example, if there is some behaviour which can be modelled using a boolean value (On or Off, 1 or 0 etc.), you may be better off representing it with a variable. \n",
    "* You should always try to avoid race conditions in your models (the outcome depends on the order transitions are fired in)\n"
